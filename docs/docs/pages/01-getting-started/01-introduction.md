# Introduction

Reflex is a full-stack framework for building and deploying web apps.

## Motivation

Pynecone was created with the following goals:

-   Pure Python
    Use Python for everything. Don't worry about learning a new language.

-   Easy to Learn
    Build and share your first app in minutes. No webdev experience required.

-   Full Flexibility
    Remain as flexible as traditional web frameworks. Pynecone is easy to get started with, but powerful enough for advanced use cases.
    Build anything from small data science apps to large, multi-page websites.
    This entire site was built and deployed with Pynecone!

-   Batteries Included
    No need to reach for a bunch of different tools. Pynecone handles the frontend, backend, and deployment of your app.

# First example
